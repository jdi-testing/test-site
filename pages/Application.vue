        The <code>v-app</code> component is REQUIRED for all applications. 
        This is the mount point for many of Vuetifyâ€™s components. <br />
        <code>v-app</code> should only be rendered within your application ONCE.

        Each of these application components have a designated location and priority that it affects within the layout system.

            <li><code>v-app-bar</code>: Is always placed at the top of an application with a lower priority than v-system-bar.</li>
            <li><code>v-bottom-navigation</code>: Is always placed at the bottom of an application with a higher priority than v-footer.</li>
            <li><code>v-footer</code>: Is always placed at the bottom of an application with a lower priority than v-bottom-navigation.</li>
            <li><code>v-navigation-drawer</code>: Can be placed on the left or right side of an application
